        <p id="p2">My full name is Claudia Alejandra Ayala Frausto and I was born in Durango, Durango Mex, but I was raised in Richmond, CA. I came to the United States when I was only 6 months and I haven't been back ever since. My birthday is on Febuary 16 and I am currently 15 years old. I enjoy playing sports, but my favorite is soccer since I have been playing since I was five. I go to Making Waves Academy in Richmond, CA. My elementary schools were Riverside and Woodrow Wilson Elementary all located in Richmond, California. Ever since I was in elementary school I knew I either wanted to be a doctor or a lawyer because I love helping people. Now I see myself pursing to become a doctor in the sports medicine field as an orthopedic surgeon. I also love watching shows and movies espcially on Showbox and Netflix.</p>
