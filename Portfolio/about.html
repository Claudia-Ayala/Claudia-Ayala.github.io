        <p id="p2">My middle name is Alejandra. I enjoy playing sports especially soccer since I have been playing since I was five years old. I go to Making Waves Academy in Richmond, CA with Johanna, Ashley, and Chris which are my classmates in my cohort for SMASH. My elementary schools were Riverside Elementary and Woodrow Wilson all located in Richmond, California. I want to be able to help others while being in the sports medicine field as an orthopedic surgeon. I love watching shows and movies espcially on showbox and netflix. </p>
